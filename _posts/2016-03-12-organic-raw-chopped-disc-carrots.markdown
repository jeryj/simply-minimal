After our hike last Wednesday when we had our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/carrots/2016/03/12/whole-organic-raw-carrots.html">pre-packed by nature carrots</a>, we just needed some more carrot to get us through the day. Know what we're sayin?

Carrots are super high in vitamin A. Like, absurdly high. According to the USDA, <strong><a href="https://www.whatscooking.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/factsheets/HHFS_CARROTS_FRESH_Dec2012.pdf">1 cup of fresh carrots has 420% of your daily value of vitamin A</a></strong>. The carrots really come in handy for the before-dinner munchy-crunchies, and this recipe surely won't disappoint.

Look to the very end of the post, below our fantastic images to see our recipe for raw, chopped disc carrots.
