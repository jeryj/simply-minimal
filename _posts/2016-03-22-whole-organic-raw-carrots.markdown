Last Wednesday, we were on a hike through local conservation land, and it was obvious: Spring is just beginning to spring.

Red Maples are showing off their red firework displays, and the raspberries are unfurling their first leaves of the season. In our yard, the daffodils are popping out under the covers of their winter rest.

But, back to the hike. Halfway through our six-mile hike, our kids needed a break and to refuel their energy reserves. What better treat than the "pre-packaged" foods nature provides us with?

The natural beauty of the carrot is a snack you can take with you. It's packaged by nature without the waste of modern consumerism. And in this post, we'll show you how to prepare and use them in a way no one can resist!
